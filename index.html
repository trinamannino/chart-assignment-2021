        <p>Civil summons are non-criminal citations issued by 25 city agencies, including the Departments of Sanitation, Buildings, and the Taxi and Limousine Commission, to name a few. Individuals can receive civil summons for a variety of infractions from being in a park after it closes to illegal dumping to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/20/nyregion/criminal-summons-civil-public-urination.html">even some instances of public drinking.</a>
        </p>

       <p>In 2020, most of the civil summons distributed in the Bronx neighborhoods of Kingsbridge Heights and Jerome Park were issued by the Department of Sanitation, as evidenced by data found on<a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/OATH-Hearings-Division-Case-Status/jz4z-kudi"> New York Open Data.</a><br><br><br></p> 




       <iframe title="Sanitation-Related Civil Summons are the Most Issued in Kingsbridge Heights and Jerome Park in the Bronx" aria-label="Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-x4Z7X" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/x4Z7X/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="599"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
       </script>
       


            
        <p><br><br>According to <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/oath/index.page">The Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings (OATH),</a> this pattern is seen all across five boroughs. The agency’s hearing division conducts summons hearings and provides resources and services to New Yorkers who are summoned by various city departments.</p>

        <p>OATH annual reports demonstrate that sanitation citations have outpaced other agency issuances long before COVID-19. In <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/oath/downloads/pdf/OATH-Annual-Report-2017.pdf">2017</a>, for example, sanitation civil summonses were almost half of all city summonses.</p>

        <p>Yet, the pandemic and its cascading effects have not helped. In late October, <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/complaints-uncollected-trash-quadruple-after-nyc-launches-new-covid-vaccine-mandate">Gothamist</a> found that 311 complaints about uncollected trash had more than quadrupled in certain areas due to the backlash of vaccine mandates for city workers. </p>

        <p>For Fanry Mercedes, a Northwest Bronx resident and restaurant worker, the sanitation problem hits close to home. While voting on Election Day, she listed the mounting trash and other quality of life issues in her neighborhood. </p>

        <p>“We need a clean city, and a quiet, safe city,” said Mercedes. “I want that, because five years ago everything was perfect. And everything now is out of control.</p>
